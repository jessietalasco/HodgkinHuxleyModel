# HodgkinHuxleyModel

## Objective
MATLAB script walking through a variety of techniques for solving differential equations before building up a hodgkin huxley style neural model, implementing ttx to see how it affects behavior, and adding in more complex channels. Calculates and plots neuron response to stimuli for set amount of time. Phase plane analysis file analyzes the model in 2D using phase plane analysis.

## Techniques
- Forward Euler's
- Backward Euler's
- ODE45 w/ variable time steps
- Phase plane analysis
