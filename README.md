# HodgkinHuxleyModel

## Objective
MATLAB script walking through a variety of techniques for solving differential equations before building up a hodgkin huxley style neural model, implementing ttx to see how it affects behavior, and adding in more complex channels. Calculates and plots neuron response to stimuli for set amount of time.

## Techniques
- Forward Euler's
- Backward Euler's
- ODE45 w/ variable time steps
